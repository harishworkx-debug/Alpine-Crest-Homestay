            <h2>Why Stay Near Chail?</h2>
            <p>
              Chail is a quiet hill station known for its heritage Palace and the
              world's highest cricket ground. Staying near Theog lets you easily
              visit Chail as a day trip while exploring the wider upper Shimla
              region like Kufri and Narkanda from a central base.
            </p>

            <h2>Alpine Crest Homestay Near Chail</h2>
            <p>
              Our homestay is located in Village Kathot near Theog. The drive to Chail
              is scenic and makes it easy to visit the sanctuary and palace during the day,
              then come back to a peaceful balcony for the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be clear and honest: Alpine Crest Homestay is not in Chail itself.
              It is in Village Kathot near Theog. We say "near Chail" because it
              serves as an excellent, comfortable base for travellers exploring the area.
            </p>

              hot water. The Deluxe Room adds a private balcony that opens onto the
              deodar ridgeline, with a seating area for taking in the view. Both are
              clean, simple and wood-warmed, with access to the shared lounge,
              terrace and garden.
            </p>
