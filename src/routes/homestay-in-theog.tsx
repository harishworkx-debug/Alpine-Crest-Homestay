            <h2>A Peaceful Homestay in Kathot Near Theog</h2>
            <p>
              Theog is a small hill town on NH-5, about an hour east of Shimla. Most
              travellers pass through it on the way to Kufri or Narkanda, but the
              ridge around Theog — and villages like Kathot just off the highway —
              holds some of the quietest mountain views in the upper Shimla hills.
              Alpine Crest Homestay sits above the apple orchards of Kathot, where
              the road leaves the highway traffic behind and the only sounds are
              wind through the deodars and distant temple bells.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a homestay at near Theog, we keep things simple and personal. The
              house is run by the family that lives here, so you get genuine local
              hospitality — directions to the best sunrise spot, a cup of chai when
              you arrive, and a kitchen that cooks what is in season.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Choose Alpine Crest Homestay Near Theog?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Family-hosted homestay with warm, local hospitality</li>
              <li>Private balconies and a terrace with wide valley views</li>
              <li>On the NH-5 corridor — easy access to Kufri, Fagu and Narkanda</li>
              <li>Home-cooked Himachali meals, including siddu and madra on request</li>
              <li>Free private parking at the house and free Wi-Fi</li>
              <li>Power backup and 24×7 hot water</li>
              <li>Taxi booking assistance for local sightseeing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rooms &amp; Accommodation</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay has two room types. The Standard Room has a comfortable
              double bed and an attached bathroom with round-the-clock hot water —
              practical and warm for couples and solo travellers. The Deluxe Room
              adds a private balcony that opens straight onto the deodar ridgeline,
              with a seating area to take in the view. Both rooms are clean, simple
              and wood-warmed, and share access to the lounge, terrace and garden.
            </p>

            <h2>Mountain Views and Pine Valley Surroundings</h2>
            <p>
              The property looks east over a wide valley of pine and deodar, with
              the Shali Tibba range rising beyond. Because the balconies face east,
              mornings begin with sunrise light spilling over the ridgeline, and
              the afternoons stay bright while the valley slowly fills with shadow.
              A short walk down through the orchards takes you to the edge of the
              pine forest, where the air is noticeably cooler and the silence is
              total.
            </p>

            <h2>Home-Cooked Himachali Food</h2>
            <p>
              Meals are cooked in the family kitchen and served in the lounge or on
              the terrace. Breakfast is parathas, eggs and chai. Lunch and dinner
              are simple home food — rajma, dal, seasonal sabzi, rice and rotis —
              with Himachali specialties like siddu (steamed bread) and madra
              (chickpeas in yoghurt gravy) available on request. Food is vegetarian
              by default, and we happily cook around allergies and preferences when
              you tell us in advance.
            </p>
