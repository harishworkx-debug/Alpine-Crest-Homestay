            <h2>A Peaceful Homestay Near Shimla</h2>
            <p>
              Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh and one of India's most
              popular hill stations, known for the Mall Road, the Ridge and the
              heritage toy train. It is the natural gateway to the surrounding hill
              destinations. But Shimla itself gets very busy, especially in the peak
              summer months, and staying in the town centre can feel crowded.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alpine Crest Homestay offers a different experience. It sits in Village
              Kathot near Theog, about an hour's drive from Shimla on NH-5. From
              here, you can spend a day exploring Shimla — the Mall Road, the
              Viceregal Lodge, Christ Church and Jakhu Temple — and then drive back
              to a quiet room with mountain air and a slow evening on the balcony.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Choose Our Homestay Near Shimla?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Peaceful, uncrowded setting away from Shimla's busy town centre</li>
              <li>Mountain and valley views from the balcony and terrace</li>
              <li>Home-cooked Himachali meals on request</li>
              <li>Free private parking at the house</li>
              <li>Free Wi-Fi and power backup</li>
              <li>Round-the-clock hot water</li>
              <li>Taxi booking assistance for Shimla, Kufri and local sightseeing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mountain Views Near Shimla</h2>
            <p>
              The property faces east over a wide valley of pine and deodar, with
              the Shali Tibba range rising beyond. The balconies catch sunrise light
              over the ridgeline, and the terrace stays bright through the afternoon
              as the valley slowly fills with shadow. A short walk down through the
              orchards reaches the edge of the pine forest, where the air is cooler
              and the silence is total.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Reach Alpine Crest From Shimla</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay is about an hour's drive from Shimla on NH-5 heading east
              toward Theog. State buses run regularly between Shimla and Theog, and
              a short taxi ride from Theog reaches the house. We can also arrange a
              taxi pickup from Shimla, Kufri or Jubbarhatti airport.
