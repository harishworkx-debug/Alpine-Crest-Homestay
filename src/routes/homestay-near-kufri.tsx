            If you are looking for a peaceful homestay near Kufri, Alpine Crest
            Homestay offers a peaceful mountain stay in Village Kathot near Theog,
            with convenient access toward Kufri. It is a quiet alternative to
            staying in Kufri itself, which gets crowded in peak season and on
            winter weekends — you get the mountain surroundings and easy access to
            Kufri's sights without the noise and the crowds.

            <h2>Why Stay Near Kufri?</h2>
            <p>
              Kufri is a popular hill station about 16 km from Shimla, known for its
              winter snow and the Himalayan Nature Park. In peak season and on
              winter weekends, it gets very busy — accommodation fills up and the
              roads slow down. Staying a short drive away, near Theog, lets you
              enjoy Kufri's sights during the day and return to a quiet setting in
              the evening.
            </p>

            <h2>Alpine Crest Homestay Near Kufri</h2>
            <p>
              Our homestay is located in Village Kathot near Theog, on the same
              NH-5 corridor as Kufri. The drive between the two is straightforward,
              making it easy to visit the Nature Park, the viewpoints at Mahasu
              Peak and the snow activities in winter, then come back to a peaceful
              balcony for the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be clear and honest: Alpine Crest Homestay is not in Kufri. It is
              in Village Kathot near Theog, Himachal Pradesh. We say "near Kufri"
              because the two are a short drive apart on the same road, and many
              travellers visiting Kufri prefer to stay in the quieter Theog area.
            </p>

            <h2>Rooms With Mountain Views</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay offers two room types. The Standard Room has a
              comfortable double bed and an attached bathroom with round-the-clock
              hot water. The Deluxe Room adds a private balcony that opens onto the
              deodar ridgeline, with a seating area for taking in the view. Both are
              clean, simple and wood-warmed, with access to the shared lounge,
              terrace and garden.
            </p>

            <h2>Things to Do in Kufri</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Himalayan Nature Park — see snow leopards and native wildlife</li>
              <li>Mahasu Peak — the highest point around, with panoramic views</li>
              <li>Winter snow activities — skiing, tobogganing and snow play</li>
              <li>Kufri Fun World — amusement park with go-karting and rides</li>
              <li>Fagu — a quiet viewpoint village a short drive beyond Kufri</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Reach Kufri From Alpine Crest</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay is in Kathot near Theog, a short and scenic drive from
              Kufri on NH-5. We can help arrange a taxi for the Kufri run and for
              wider sightseeing. Free private parking is available right at the
              house if you are driving yourself.
