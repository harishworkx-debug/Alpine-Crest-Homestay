            <h2>Why Stay Near Fagu?</h2>
            <p>
              Fagu is a small, quiet village on the Shimla-Narkanda road, famous for
              its lush apple orchards and sweeping views of the Himalayas. Staying near
              Theog lets you easily visit Fagu as a quick trip while avoiding the
              tourist rush of nearby Kufri.
            </p>

            <h2>Alpine Crest Homestay Near Fagu</h2>
            <p>
              Our homestay is located in Village Kathot near Theog. The scenic drive
              makes it extremely easy to visit Fagu's orchards during the day,
              then come back to a peaceful balcony for the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be clear and honest: Alpine Crest Homestay is not in Fagu itself.
              It is in Village Kathot near Theog. We say "near Fagu" because it
              serves as an excellent, comfortable base for travellers exploring the area.
            </p>

            <h2>Rooms With Mountain Views</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay offers two room types. The Standard Room has a
              comfortable double bed and an attached bathroom with round-the-clock
              hot water. The Deluxe Room adds a private balcony that opens onto the
              deodar ridgeline, with a seating area for taking in the view. Both are
              clean, simple and wood-warmed, with access to the shared lounge,
              terrace and garden.
            </p>

            <h2>Things to Do in Fagu</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Walk through the local apple and potato farms</li>
              <li>Enjoy panoramic views of the greater Himalayan range</li>
              <li>Visit local village temples for authentic Himachali culture</li>
              <li>Take short nature walks around the Fagu ridgeline</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Reach Fagu From Alpine Crest</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay is a very short, scenic drive from Fagu on NH-5. We can help arrange
              a taxi for the trip to Fagu and for wider sightseeing. Free private
              parking is available right at the house if you are driving yourself.
