            <h2>Why Stay Near Narkanda?</h2>
            <p>
              Narkanda is a beautiful hill town about 60 km from Shimla, known for
              its skiing slopes in winter and Hatu Peak. Due to its higher altitude,
              it gets quite cold and accommodation can fill up quickly. Staying near
              Theog lets you enjoy Narkanda's sights as a day trip while resting in
              a slightly warmer, quiet setting in the evening.
            </p>

            <h2>Alpine Crest Homestay Near Narkanda</h2>
            <p>
              Our homestay is located in Village Kathot near Theog, on NH-5, the same
              route that goes to Narkanda. The scenic drive makes it easy to visit
              Narkanda, the Hatu Peak, and the apple belt of Kotgarh during the day,
              then come back to a peaceful balcony for the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be clear and honest: Alpine Crest Homestay is not in Narkanda town itself.
              It is in Village Kathot near Theog. We say "near Narkanda" because it
              serves as an excellent, comfortable base for travellers exploring the region.
            </p>

            <h2>Rooms With Mountain Views</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay offers two room types. The Standard Room has a
              comfortable double bed and an attached bathroom with round-the-clock
              hot water. The Deluxe Room adds a private balcony that opens onto the
              deodar ridgeline, with a seating area for taking in the view. Both are
              clean, simple and wood-warmed, with access to the shared lounge,
              terrace and garden.
            </p>

            <h2>Things to Do in Narkanda</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Hatu Peak — trek or drive up for panoramic Himalayan views</li>
              <li>Winter skiing — hit the slopes in January and February</li>
              <li>Apple Orchards — visit Kotgarh and Thanedhar, the apple bowl of India</li>
              <li>Tani Jubbar Lake — a peaceful spot surrounded by pine trees</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Reach Narkanda From Alpine Crest</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay is a scenic drive from Narkanda on NH-5. We can help arrange
              a taxi for the trip to Narkanda and for wider sightseeing. Free private
              parking is available right at the house if you are driving yourself.
