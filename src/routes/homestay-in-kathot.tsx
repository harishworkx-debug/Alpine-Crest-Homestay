            <h2>Why Stay Near Fagu?</h2>
            <p>
              Fagu is a small Himalayan village on NH-5, about 20 km beyond Kufri
              on the way to Narkanda. It sits at around 2,500 metres, surrounded by
              apple orchards, pine forests and open meadows with wide views of the
              surrounding ranges. Unlike Kufri and Shimla, Fagu sees far fewer
              tourists — it is the kind of place where the road goes quiet and the
              mountains feel close.
            </p>
            <p>
              Travellers come to Fagu for the viewpoints, for the peace, and for the
              drive itself — the stretch between Kufri and Fagu is one of the most
              scenic in the upper Shimla hills. Staying at Alpine Crest Homestay
              near Theog gives you easy access to Fagu while keeping you close to
              Kufri, Theog and Shimla as well.
            </p>

            <h2>Alpine Crest Homestay — Your Base Near Fagu</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay is in Village Kathot near Theog, on the same NH-5
              corridor that continues to Fagu. The drive is short and scenic, making
              it easy to visit Fagu's viewpoints for the day and return to a
              comfortable room with a private balcony in the evening. To be clear:
              the homestay is near Theog, not in Fagu itself — but it is a
              convenient and peaceful base for exploring the Fagu area.
            </p>

            <h2>What to See Around Fagu</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Viewpoints — wide panoramas of the Himalayan ranges from open meadows</li>
              <li>Apple orchards — walk through the orchards, especially beautiful in bloom season</li>
              <li>Pine forest trails — quiet walks through deodar and pine</li>
              <li>Photography — sunrise and sunset light over the ridgeline</li>
              <li>The drive from Kufri to Fagu — one of the most scenic stretches around Shimla</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rooms &amp; Comfort</h2>
            <p>
              The Standard Room has a comfortable double bed and an attached
              bathroom with round-the-clock hot water. The Deluxe Room adds a
              private balcony that opens onto the deodar ridgeline, with a seating
              area for taking in the view. Both share access to the lounge, terrace
              and garden.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting to Fagu From Alpine Crest</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay is on NH-5 near Theog. Continue on the same highway
              through Kufri to reach Fagu — roughly a 45-minute drive. We can
              arrange a taxi for the trip and for wider sightseeing.
