            <h2>Why Stay Near Narkanda?</h2>
            <p>
              Narkanda is a hill town about 60 km from Shimla on NH-5, sitting at
              nearly 2,700 metres. It is known for Hatu Peak — the highest point in
              the area with a temple and panoramic views — for skiing in winter, and
              for the apple belt of Kotgarh and Thanedar. The area is quieter than
              Shimla and Kufri, with dense pine and deodar forests and some of the
              best sunrise and sunset views in the region.
            </p>

            <h2>Alpine Crest Homestay — A Peaceful Base Near Narkanda</h2>
            <p>
              Alpine Crest Homestay is in Village Kathot near Theog, on the same
              NH-5 corridor that continues to Narkanda. The drive from the homestay
              to Narkanda is scenic and straightforward, making it easy to head up
              for a day of sightseeing and return to a quiet room in the evening.
              To be clear: the homestay is near Theog, not in Narkanda itself — but
              it is a convenient and peaceful base for travellers exploring the
              Narkanda area.
            </p>

            <h2>What to See in Narkanda</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Hatu Peak — drive or trek to the summit for 360-degree Himalayan views</li>
              <li>Hatu Mata Temple — a small temple at the top of Hatu Peak</li>
              <li>Skiing — Narkanda has a ski slope operated by HP Tourism in winter</li>
              <li>Kotgarh and Thanedar — the heart of Himachal's apple country</li>
              <li>Stokes Farm — heritage apple orchards with a story going back to 1916</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rooms &amp; Comfort</h2>
            <p>
              After a day exploring Narkanda, come back to a comfortable room. The
              Standard Room has a double bed and attached bathroom with hot water.
              The Deluxe Room adds a private balcony with valley views and a seating
              area. Both share access to the lounge, terrace and garden.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting to Narkanda From Alpine Crest</h2>
            <p>
              The homestay is on NH-5 near Theog. Continue on the same highway east
              through Fagu and Matiana to reach Narkanda — roughly a 90-minute
              drive. We can arrange a taxi for the trip and for wider sightseeing.
